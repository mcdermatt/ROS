Requires instillation of PCL from binary in order to run: ---------------------------

follow instructions here:
https://alwynm.github.io/blog/general/pcl

>> cd ~/Downloads
>> git clone https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl
>> tar xvfj pcl-pcl-1.13.0.tar.gz
>> cd pcl-pcl-1.13.0 && mkdir build && cd build
>> cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
>> make -j2
>> make install


you may run into issues with CUDA compiler: "No CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER could be found"

if so, you need to add filepath of nvcc as an enviornemnt variable with the following bash command:

>> export CUDACXX=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Once PCL is built from source, you need to modify <CMakeLists.txt> of the LOAM package 
to point towards compiled PCL directory  

>> cd ~/catkin_ws/src/LOAM_3D_LIDARs/
>> subl CMakeLists.txt

debugging to get rid of built in PCL version that comes with ROS
(causes segfault):

Turns out you can sidestep installing PCL from source and getting incorrect version built in with ROS-Noetic by:

set "find_package(PCL REQUIRED)" in LOAM_3D_LIDARS CMakeLists.txt (exclude version number)
>> sudo apt-get remove --purge libpcl*
>> sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-perception
